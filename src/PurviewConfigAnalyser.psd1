- [FIX] Added automatic output directory creation when needed
- [FIX] Better error handling for file path validation
- Validation tests now work seamlessly for installed modules

## New in v1.0.5 - CRITICAL PATH FIX
- [CRITICAL FIX] Fixed config file path resolution for installed modules
- [FIX] Corrected PSScriptRoot path calculations from "../../config" to "../config"

- Module now fully functional with all required configuration files

## New in v1.0.3
- [CRITICAL FIX] Fixed all remaining Unicode quote character issues that caused parser errors
- [FIX] Replaced smart quotes (U+2018, U+2019, U+201C, U+201D) with standard ASCII quotes
